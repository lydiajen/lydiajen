## Hello, Friends! 
Back in 2018, I purchased a humble, $5 Peace Lily from Trader Joes. Now, I have over fifty plants. Most were collected slowly over this two-year period – emphasis on the slowly. Why? I knew early on that I was already in too deep, so I made a rule for myself. I set a personal limit of a $4 plant budget per week. This means that if I wanted to purchase a more expensive plant, I had to wait. (There is one exception, maybe I’ll share if I end up propagating him.) 
I’m not opposed to waiting, as I often enjoy making mini bets like “How long can I go without XYZ” or “Six Month Restriction of Such and Such.” However, the temptation to line my windowsill with some greenery proved to be quite the challenge. My solution to that? Propagating the plants I already had. 

Thus began my journey into researching, clipping, and callousing my plant cuttings.  
Given that there are several different propagation strategies that one can select, I wanted to experiment to see which method produced the best results. For my succulents, I removed multiple leaves and placed them in three different environments: dirt, air and water. Although each method sprouted roots and growth, I found that the leaves placed in dirt were the most successful. 
In one of my most memorable experiments, I successfully propagated a monstrose variegated Ghost Plant (Graptopetalum Paraguayense) with a genetic mutation in her growth pattern that caused the edges of her leaves to round off and elongate instead of the usual pointy-edged clustering we’re used to seeing. She’s a beaut, and I plan on propagating from her leaves to see if and how her growth pattern changes.

Initially, this project wasn’t designed to span into a multiyear activity, but upon starting, I found that there was and still is so much to the world of horticulture that I can learn from. In hindsight, I wish I started collecting this data from the very beginning. From a personal level, I think I have a general understanding of which methods produce the best results – however, if I had the numbers, it would’ve been interesting to see if the numbers reflect that opinion. 
That’s why I’m officially launching: **Propagation Station!** 

I am flexible to change, but as of right now, I will be collecting data on the following variables:
*	Distance from window
*	Which direction the sun points
*	How many times per week do I need to water it 
*	How many weeks before roots emerge
*	Propagation style (water, dirt, air etc) 
*	Does the plant survive past a year 

My first project will be one ginger root and two avocado pits — plants I have absolutely no experience in propagating with. I'll be taking photos, so tune in soon to check in on their progress. As always, any suggestions to any part of this project will be appreciated.
